# rust-examples

# rust-apps
simple, working rust apps to learn from 
1 to 25 is compiled in windows, 25 to 50 (wip) will be compiled in Linux.

Sometimes when learning a new lang it is nice to compile and run a few example apps to see if you like the  ecosystem. 
This repo will be continously updated. It is meant to be a huge library of simple Rust example apps that work. Use it for the apps themselves
or use it to help learn Rust coding.
